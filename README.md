# ShapeUp Fitness App

Welcome to ShapeUp,

Fitness app that helps you track your workout progress and stay on top of your fitness goals.

## Introduction

I createdc ShapeUp because I kept forgetting which part to workout when I arrive to the gym. I always wondered was it Leg day or arm day..? It happened especially when I missed a workout day. SO I created this app to keep track of my workouts. The app combines a variety of exercises to help users achieve results in a short amount of time. The app was developed using React, Node.js v19, and was deployed on Vercel. The site is responsive and works on mobile, tablet, and desktop devices.

## Features

Animated gifs that allows users to learn new exirceses
A variety of workout regimes to choose from
Responsive design that works on all devices
Constantly updated with new features and workout regimes
